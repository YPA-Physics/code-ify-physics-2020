# Code-ify Physics! 2020

We are glad you are participating in YPA's third contest ever, Code-ify Physics! 2020. You may code any physics related program you wish in Python, Java, or any other programming languages. Possibilities include educational software, simulations and demonstrations, websites, and much more! The total prizes available are worth around \$1000!

If you are here about the submission process go straight to the [submission](#submission) part.

## Prizes

1. The top 3 contestants will win a 1 year licenses for both Wolfram | One and Wolfram | Alpha (\$300+ VALUE for each winner).
2. More prizes may be added depending on how much interest is shown.

## Register

1. Click this [link](1) to register
2. Registration must be completed before the submission deadline.
3. This is an individual contest.
4. You must be going to high school as of fall 2020 in order to participate.
5. After registering, you will receive a message confirming your registration within a couple days.

## Tasks

1. Combine physics with computer science in an interesting way.
2. Submit your codebase and a description of your project.
   - Any programming language may be used.
   - Include a README file with a description of your project as well as any necessary setup procedures (no longer than 600 words).
3. The submissions will be judged on specific criteria.
   - Useability/Effectiveness: your project accurately serves its designed purpose.
   - Uniqueness/Creativity: novelty and originality of ideas are highly valued.
   - Implementation of physics: your program must mainly be centered around something physics-related.
   - Complexity: thought and time has been put into the project.

## Rules

1. All work must be largely the contestant’s (you may still use libraries and frameworks, just make sure to build on top of them).
2. If your program is not self explanatory, then you are expected to submit a google docs/word document/pdf explain how to use your program with max 600 words, or have a tutorial on your program.
3. Do not have your name on your program for judging purposes.

## Submission

### Submission deadline is 28 November

The submission via GitHub is desired by judges. This is easier to look at the code and judge. The submitting process contains a few steps(_Note:_ You need a GitHub account to do this. If you do not have one you can register from [here][2])

### Create a Git repository on your local machine, work on it, and upload it to a public GitHub repository when you are done. Email us the link by the submission deadline (make sure the repository is public)!

### If you are not using a source control system

Fortunately there is no need for fancy source control systems and command line interactions if you are not familiar with them. You can just upload your files via GitHub's web page. Create a new repository and add files using the upload button.


#### If you are confused about anything, join our [Discord server][5] and questions, our team is willing to help you out with anything you need!

### Submission via email

If you are having issues with submission process, consider join to our [Discord server][5] if anyone does not help or unable to help feel free to ping spitfire#8420. If you are still having issues then feel free to email your submission folder to YPAsubmission@gmail.com. This has to contain same content with submission via GitHub.

## Things to keep in mind

### Your project should be easy to set-up

You should make sure your project is easy to set up for us. It should not take us more than a few steps to get your project up and running, and those steps should be well-documented in your project’s README file.

### Write a good README

Your project has to include documentation. At the very least, it should include instructions on how to set-up and run your projects, but keep in mind that a README is the first thing people typically see when they look at a project on GitHub. A good README includes a short description of the project, installation instructions, and often documents common usage of the application.

### The main language of your project should be English

As English is the only language the judges share, we require you to use English as the main language for your project. This means that your variable names, code comments, `git` commit messages, and documentation should all be in English. The text displayed in your result of the project should also be in English, although you are allowed to provide the user with options for internationalization and translation(but not required).
